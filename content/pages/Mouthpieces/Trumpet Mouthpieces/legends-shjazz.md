subtitle = ".663″ SH Jazz Trumpet Mouthpiece $100.00 – $125.00 The Legends SH Jazz is a great choice for smoky jazz as well as symphonic music. It has a comfortable semi-round rim with a .663″ inside diameter. The cup is medium shallow (similar to Bach D). It has an open throat (#25) and a Legends Chicago (broad) backbore for a free and open blow. The Big Daddy blank adds mass to broaden the core and darken the sound. This mouthpiece is perfect for a rich, melodious sound without sacrificing the flexibility needed for quick technical jazz solos and classical symphonic pieces. "
