subtitle = "an unusual 1937 Bach. \"3861 is a very odd Bach. It was made for Hans Bach (Vincent’s Brother) to sell in his store. It was built with a #7 bell and #5 leadpipe, however the valves are bizarre, as they are marked as new type E (same as today), but then the bore as .448” rather than Bach’s .450”. Bach horns built with .448” bores were built with HN White (King) valve blocks – so this is odd.\" Thank You Ron Berndt for this wonderful information!"
