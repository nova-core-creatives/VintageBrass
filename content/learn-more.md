### About Me

I am a player who likes to restore vintage trumpets as a hobby. This site reflects my interest in vintage trumpets, working on them, and also my music. I was fortunate to grow up and study in New York when there was a viable jazz scene and I played with such greats as Howard McGee, Kenny Dorham, Vinny Burke, Frank Foster and many others. If you see an instrument on here that interests you e-mail me and we can discuss it. This is not a store in the traditional sense but I do sell these instruments w2hen the time is right. I envision this site as a meeting place and a place to share my efforts as a restore and player/composer. I have put horns in the hands of some prominent players from the Boston Pops, Chicago Symphony and jazz players too.

If this interests you, take a look around and drop me a line if you see a must have instrument, if you need some help, or if you'd just like to talk brass! When you find your way to my music, have a listen and find me on any popular music streaming platform.

_Talk to you soon!_
