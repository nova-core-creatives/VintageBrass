When I first started seriously collecting brasswind instruments, brass instruments were very inexpensive. There were many great deals to be had and many players were selling their instruments in order to pay for more expensive newer models. Times have changed. Many of these same players are now replacing their brass with silver or even trumpets made out of plastic! I believe in the tried and true brass of our greatest generations. That is why vintage brass is all the rage right now by top professionals, educators and collectors.

"What's up with all this brass?" you might ask yourself. "Why would someone want an old tarnished trumpet or horn that probably plays badly?" Well, my friend, there are several good reasons why people are seeking out older brass over new brass offerings from manufacturers both large and small:

**1) Sound** - Old instruments that have been cared for sound better than new brass. New brass needs to be played several times to "loosen up" and reach its full potential.

**2) Volume** - Vintage brass instruments tend to play much louder than new brass, and there is a larger variety of vintage horns that will produce good volume (even the small ones).

**3) Richness and Warmth** - There is something appealing about listening or playing an instrument that has lost some of its edge but still holds on to some of that vintage tone.

**4) Orchestral Quality** - Many orchestra conductors prefer vintage brass as they feel it produces a more mellow and rich tone.

**5) Intonation** - As we all know, tuners are not perfect and each valve slide
