/*Comments: This is a very touchy Javascript made specifically for paulayickvintagebrass.com
  It works in conjunction with fileman.cgi which is located in the CGI directory.
  It collects part of the current URL for the cgi script to process.
  The split functions use the current URL for gathering the part of the URL needed.
  You cannot rename this file unless you first change the name also in the second split function below.
  Look at the sample URL below.  This much is taken from it:  "Trumpets/Conn%2048B%20Vocabell%20%23349338/"
  The rest is discarded.  The portion taken is joined together with the absolute path of the site.  This
  happens unseen within the cgi script.
